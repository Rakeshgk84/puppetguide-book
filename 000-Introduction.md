# Introduction

There's a question that everybody keeps on making.

A question that has no real answer.

Maybe it has more answers than the people you ask to.

A question that embodies deeper meanings and wider knowledge.

A question that nobody really knows how to answer correctly,
but everybody know something about it.

The answer is not 42,
the question is "What is DevOps?"

In this book you will not get any answer to such an overwhelming query.

This is a Puppet book.

A book about Puppet Universe, possibly about any topic you can think about when dealing with Puppet.

This *might* be a book around [DevOps] practices,
or it might not be.

Such as dead and alive cats: It depends on the observer.

Or maybe the authors.

Worst of all, this book will try to be funny,

sometimes,

and it will fail.

Bear with us, it's the price we ask for your deeper Puppet awareness.
